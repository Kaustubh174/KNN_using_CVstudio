# KNN using CVstudio #
<br> In this we will train, test and deploy a model that can classify Cats and dogs using K nearest neighbour method.
<br>
<br> Steps are as follows:
<br>1. Go to CV studio (https://vision.skills.network/) and sign in into your IBM cloud account.

<br>2. Once you have sign in, you will next need to click on New project. Write the name of your project and select the type as classification. Then click on create.

<br>3.Then you need to download the dataset in image format. Here you can create your own data set or use this data set (https://cv-studio-accessible.s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cats_dogs_images_.zip). Next click on upload and you can upload the images and click on annotate

<br>4. You can see that CV studio has automatically detected the dogs and cats and labelled the dataset accordingly. If it does not detects then you can click on create label and then you can label the training data as you want. Next click on train model.

<br>5.Next you need click on create a training run and write the name of the training along with it select the algorithm to be used. Over here you will select SVM as for image format SVM fits better and training tool as jupiter notebook. Next you need to click on jupiter notebook and run the code. Finally click on create training run and then click on use model.

<br>5. Then you need to name you application, select model in this project and select the model you trained. select the jupiter notebook and run the model.
